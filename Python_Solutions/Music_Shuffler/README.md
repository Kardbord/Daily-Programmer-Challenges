Personal Challenge: Decent Music Shuffler

Not a Daily Programmer challenge, so no link on this one.

Basically just a simple project to help me get more familiar with Python.
Inspired by my annoyance at iTunes and Spotify due to their inability to provide a different shuffled playlist
rather than the same two 'shuffles' every time.
