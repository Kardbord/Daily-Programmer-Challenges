Personal Challenge: Decent Music Shuffler

Not a Daily Programmer challenge, so no link on this one.

Basically I'm just tired of crappy shuffles on Spotify and iTunes
where there's only really two variations on a playlist, 
rather than a new one each time.
So I'm going to make my own shuffler. Need to build some sort of database
that stores songs. If I feel like making it more difficult I'll include artists,
albums, etc. Good practice for me to use object oriented programming techniques
in python. Overall shouldn't be too hard. Just for fun and for practice.
