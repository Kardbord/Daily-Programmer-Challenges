Thought 1
    Algorithm:

    1. Begin w/ least significant digit at position n.
    2. Compare it to digit in position n - 1, n - 2, etc until it is larger than the digit in that position, and
       then swap the two.

         If steps 1 and 2 result in reaching the most significant digit without success in step 2, begin again at
         position n - 1 and repeat steps one and two until step two is successful
