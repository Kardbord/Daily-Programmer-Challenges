My own challenges:
   
    - Music shuffler
        - iTunes and Spotify's shuffle button sucks. Not a true shuffle, and only actually provides one or two different shuffles
	    - shouldn't be too hard --- just a little something to vent my frustration on
	        - What? Lack of good shuffling is annoying.
        - Pretty much just have to find an efficient way to take a load of numbers and list them in a random order whenever desired.
	- Could actually create some sort of database with artist, track name, album, etc if I felt like an extra challenge
	    - probably should do this since shuffling numbers is basically inherently present in every programming language...
